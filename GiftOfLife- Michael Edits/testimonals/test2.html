        When I was diagnosed with leukemia, a bone marrow transplant was my only hope.

        The procedure was tough, but I had an amazing support system and an incredible medical team who helped me through it.
        
        Today, I'm cancer-free and grateful to the donor who made it all possible. To anyone facing a bone marrow transplant, don't give up â€“ there is hope.    </p>
